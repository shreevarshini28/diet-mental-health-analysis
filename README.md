This project explores how specific dietary patterns impact mental health outcomes such as depression and anxiety. Using simulated data, I analyzed correlations between nutrient intake and mental health scores.

## ðŸ›  Tools Used
- Python (Pandas, Matplotlib)
- Power BI
- Excel

## ðŸ“ˆ Key Skills Demonstrated
- Data cleaning and transformation
- Correlation analysis
- Data visualization
- Health-focused analytics

## ðŸ“‹ Project Steps
1. Imported survey data on nutrient intake and mental health scores.
2. Cleaned and normalized data using Python.
3. Analyzed correlations between nutrients (e.g., Omega-3, sugar) and mood.
4. Created visualizations using Power BI.
5. Summarized insights for policy-level suggestions.
